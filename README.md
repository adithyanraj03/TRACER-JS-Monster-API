# TRACER-JS-Monster-API
Tracer implemented in JavaScript using the Canvas API and embedding it in HTML.
This is a simple game where you control a monster using the arrow keys on your keyboard. The goal is to move the monster around the canvas without hitting the boundaries.

## How to Play

1. Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to control the monster's movement.
2. The monster will move in the direction of the arrow key you press.
3. Avoid hitting the boundaries of the canvas, as this will cause the monster to bounce back.
4. Keep moving the monster around the canvas to test your skills and have fun!

## Technologies Used

- HTML5 Canvas: Used to create the game environment and draw the monster.
- JavaScript: Used to handle user input, update the monster's position, and animate the game.
